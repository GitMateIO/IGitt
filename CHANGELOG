0.4.0
=====

Start the changelog :)

Changes since 0.3.0:

- New endpoints are supported, e.g. searching issues.
- Especially handle_webhook for getting related IGitt objects and events for webhook
  without having to deal with github/lab directly.
- Everything is cached implicitly, IGitt only does requests when needed.
  There's a `.refresh` method for every class that holds data if you want
  fresh data.

BREAKING CHANGES:

- We have token classes now. Use them!
